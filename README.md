# Keybie - Hackpad  

Keybie is a 12-key macropad with a rotary encoder and an OLED display! It uses KMK firmare and is my first-ever hardware project with a PCB. :)<br>

# BOM  

My macropad includes materials that are given by Hack Club!    
12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes  
12x MX-Style switches  
1x EC11 Rotary encoders  
1x 0.91 inch OLED displays  
12x Blank DSA keycaps  

# PCB  
Here is my PCB! Made in KiCad (took me forever to decide what to include ngl T-T)
