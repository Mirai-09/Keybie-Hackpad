# Keybie - Hackpad

Keybie is a 12-key macropad with a rotary encoder and an OLED display! It uses KMK firmare and is my first-ever hardware project with a PCB :) .<br>

# BOM

12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes  
12x MX-Style switches  
1x EC11 Rotary encoders  
1x 0.91 inch OLED displays  
12x Blank DSA keycaps  

# PCB
